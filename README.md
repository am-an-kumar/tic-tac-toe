## Instructions

An ugly implementation of the basic game, tic tac toe.

To play the game, install the dependencies using 'npm install' and then run:

- npm run dev/ npm run dev:hot - this will open up a local server
- npm run build - this will generate a production build, open the markup file in browser

## Dependencies

This project is built using React. I am using a custom boilerplate setup for this one, so there are a lot of dev dependencies for a smooth development experience. But, main dependencies used are :

- react
- react-dom
- prop-types

## Contributing

I built this project just to get familiar with the way in which React components work. The project is complete with all desired functionalities and there is no known bugs. The styling is off because i focused only on React component organization. Feel free to use it.
